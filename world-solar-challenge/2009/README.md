# World Solar Challenge: 2009

Sasha Zbrozek (Stanford 2010) created this CSV for the WSC route. This was
later released in 2013 on Stanford's blog. In his own words:

> Some time ago I wrote a program to extract elevation data from the 
> [Shuttle Radar Topography Mission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRTM) 
> ([raw data](http://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/)) following a CSV route. 
> I used [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com/) to come up with a rough 
> route and export the KML, then ran it through 
> [GPSBabel](http://www.gpsbabel.org/) to turn it into an easy-to-parse CSV. 
> This was my "hello world in [Go](http://golang.org/)" project.
>
> My program supersamples and does a bilinear interpolation on the route. It's 
> not perfect, but it's better than nothing. With any luck the team will 
> collect a better route profile during the race this year. In the mean time, 
> information wants to be free, so happy strategery-ing.
